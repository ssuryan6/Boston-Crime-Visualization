Our main analysis aim is to see if Bostin is a safer place compared to other cities in the USA by
analyzing the crime percentage in Boston through investigating different cities in Massachusetts.
our analysis can help the Boston police to reduce the crimes that are frequently occurring by
exploring some key questions that we have come up with which are related to Affected districts,
districts with more crime, the time at which most crimes occur and unemployment rate which
can also be helpful to see the most affordable districts depending upon the unemployment rate.
To achieve solutions to these analyses it completely depends on the data, whether the data has
null values or not. So first these values must be removed if there are any. This also improves the
dataset so that it can be more helpful and useful for future use
